  <h2>Who is Vincent van Gogh?</h2>
  <blockquote
  <p>"I can do nothing about it if my paintings don’t sell.
The day will come, though, when people will see that they’re worth more than the cost of the paint and my subsistence, very meagre in fact, that we put into them." - Vincent van Gogh, <a href=https://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let712/letter.html#translation>letter 712</a> to Theo van Gogh, ~25 Oct 1888.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Vincent Williem van Gogh was on born 30 March 1853 and he lived only 37 years, dying on 29 July 1890. I think he had a very sad life as his work only became famous and popular after he died. He was very close with his younger brother, Theo (Theodorus van Gogh). Theo passed 6 months after van Gogh, at age 33, leaving behind Jo (Johanna van Gogh-Bonger) <q>with their baby son and an apartment filled with his brother Vincent's artworks.</q>
    <a href=https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/stories/the-woman-who-made-vincent-famous>(the woman who made Vincent famous)</a> Jo made Vincent's work famous in her lifetime, and also translated hundreds of letters between the brothers to English.</p>

  <h2>Where can I see The Starry Night?</h2>
  <p>The Starry Night is on display at MoMa, The Museum of Modern Art, in New York City. This is the first van Gogh painting to enter a New York museum collection.</p>

  <p>According to <a href=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79802>MoMa:</a>
  "In creating this image of the night sky—dominated by the bright moon at right and Venus at center left—van Gogh heralded modern painting’s new embrace of mood, expression, symbol, and sentiment. Inspired by the view from his window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy, in southern France, where the artist spent twelve months in 1889–90 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses, The Starry Night (made in mid-June) is both an exercise in observation and a clear departure from it. The vision took place at night, yet the painting, among hundreds of artworks van Gogh made that year, was created in several sessions during the day, under entirely different atmospheric conditions. The picturesque village nestled below the hills was based on other views—it could not be seen from his window—and the cypress at left appears much closer than it was. And although certain features of the sky have been reconstructed as observed, the artist altered celestial shapes and added a sense of glow.</p>

<p></p>Van Gogh assigned an emotional language to night and nature that took them far from their actual appearances. Dominated by vivid blues and yellows applied with gestural verve and immediacy, The Starry Night also demonstrates how inseparable van Gogh’s vision was from the new procedures of painting he had devised, in which color and paint describe a world outside the artwork even as they telegraph their own status as, merely, color and paint."</p>
  
  <h3>The significance of Cypress Trees</h3>
    <p>Searching the internet, there are several intepretations of the Cypress Trees:</p>
   <ul>
        <li>They are usually not in pairs, though van Gogh painted them in pairs.</li>
        <li>The Cypress Trees in The Starry Night is quite different from those in <a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437980>Cypresses (1889)</a> and <a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436535>Wheat Field with Cypresses (1889).</a></li>
        <li>It symbolises death and everlasting life, and planted near cemetries.</li>
       <li>The two Cypress trees in The Starry Night could symbolised van Gogh and Theo, his brother; the two-state/ personality van Gogh was suffering from.</li>
     <li>The Cypress Trees are also a contrast to Sunflowers (symbolises life) that van Gogh painted.</li>
    </ul>
