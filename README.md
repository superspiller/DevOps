This project is to display a HTML pages about the Artist Vincent van Gogh. It has 4 files/ parts:
1. README - this file
2. index.html - contains the content
3. styles.css - for the styling of the webpage
4. images/ several images within this folder

My other self (as a non-collaborator; or anyone can contribute/ propose changes - as this is a publc repository) will be working on another file/ part for the link to the Sunflower. 
5. sunflower.html

I will then need to review the propose change (via "Pull Requests"), accept the proposal, and re-run the workflow as below.

How to make updates:
If you need to update the content, that would be in the index.html or the sunflower.html.
If you need to update the styling (fonts, colors, format), that would be in the styles.css

For every update made, you would need to add a description, and then commit the changes.
Next, go to "Actions", click on the workflow (pages build and deployment), click on the button "Re-run all jobs".
Wait for the workflow to finish running.
Go to Settings, click on pages on the left-side bar, clikc on "Visit site" button. You will now be able to the the changes that you have committed.
